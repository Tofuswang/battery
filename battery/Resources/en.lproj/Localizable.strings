Currently studying Economics at National Taipei University.\n\nOur generation grew up in the internet wave, yet we're still trapped in the afterglow of the previous generation's dreams. They said building an app could change the world; We believed, but the world has already turned the page.\n\nSocial Battery points to this phenomenon: We need to stop chasing outdated scripts, because those dreams won't bring us the future anymore.\n\nIf building apps is no longer a dream, we must learn to dream for ourselves. We need new languages, new illusions, to build a future that belongs to Gen Z.";
